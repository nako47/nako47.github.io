Hello there!

**My name is Nako, I’m 18 years old, I’m I’m just a simple anonymity and privacy and floss activist that blogs about my knowledge, i love learning more!** 

I also strongly believe privacy should be a universal right and that anonymity should never become illegal, and everyone should have access to floss software. I don’t want our lives to turn into Gattaca, Minority Report, Black Mirror, or 1984 (Too late for that one, I’m afraid). I do not want our laws and rights to become terms of services.
as for some dark sides ofc, i really don’t give a fuck about human rights or shame or rules, but really don’t like to seeing you knowing or unknowingly get hurt, see, the world is already corrupted, humans are fucked up, humanity is a joke, society it’s all about the rules and the power and rule makers are rule breaker, and humans are in my opinion worse than animals, i’ll write my view about society soon (i hope (*don’t count on it*) and mention here.

My goal is to bring accessible knowledge on these topics to the many and hopefully reach the few good people who really need it. In this specific case, I think the needs of the few outweigh the needs of the many.

### Some facts about me:

- i am jobless, please feed me!
- I enjoy good content, tho, i hate wasting time, but yet, i don’t have anything to do…

**(i might update soon, for now, i’ll focus for more important sections, sorry if you are not satisfied, i’ll make it interesting asap!)**
