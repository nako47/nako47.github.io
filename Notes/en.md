Denuvo DRM that get cracked by CODEX or any existing cracks by Voksi. CPY, Baldman, and possibly DeltaT cracks of D games will work under WINE, from what I've seen. The old 3DM cracks for D games may or may not work. Miscellaneous other crackers D cracks may or may not work, eg FCKDRM or the Unity/C# games that have been cracked by CODEX, ALI213, SKIDROW, etc

Looking Glass - For KVM Frame Relay - High Performance Windows VM Gaming
Quote
Geoffrey McRae has published the code to the "Looking Glass" project he's been working on as a "extremely low-latency" KVM frame relay implementation for guests with VGA PCI pass-through.
Long story short this allows for a graphics card PCI pass-through setup with a KVM guest whereby no separate monitor is needed but rather Looking Glass is like a virtual display for that GPU dedicated to the VM and displays the VM's rendered contents on your main monitor/GPU. Up to now those wanting to use a secondary graphics card pass-through setup with a virtual machine had to use a separate monitor, but with Looking Glass you can get by with a single monitor for the system.

Looking Glass is an open source application that allows the use of a KVM Kernel-based Virtual Machine configured for VGA PCI Pass-through without an attached physical monitor, keyboard or mouse. This is the final step required to move away from dual booting with other operating systems for legacy programs that require high performance graphics.
How does Looking Glass work?

Host Own .onion Website in Dark Web
Onion.Sh Tor2Web Proxy
Onion.Sh is a reverse proxy that forwards HTTP requests to requested Tor hidden services without the need to download new software.
Just replace the URL in your browser from .onion to .onion.sh and browse.
For example zqktlwi4i34kbat3.onion becomes zqktlwi4i34kbat3.onion.sh
Onion.Sh is a proxy service which does not host and is not responsible for any content you find on a hidden service.

Windows Lite Templates SupportBios/Uefi boot KVM/XEN/Hyper-V Virtualization
As many of you are aware, I have been building lite templates allowing Microsoft Windows to be easily installed onto servers from AWS Cloud/Google Cloud/Microsoft Azure Cloud/Oracle Cloud/Other, etc. and making them available via my website:
I have been creating windows suitable for use on low-end machines. You can run windows 7 smoothly on machines with 512M RAM.
Get the template from
For example 1: The name of the template file, winsrv2016-data-x64-us.vhd.gz is suitable for booting in the BIOS
For example 2: The name of the template file, winsrv2016-data-x64-us-efi.vhd.gz is suitable for booting from UEFI
You can use script to install automatically under Debian/Ubuntu
apt-get update
apt-get install -y xz-utils openssl gawk file
wget --no-check-certificate -qO InstallNET.sh '
You can also use rescue mode to install
wget --no-check-certificate -qO- "Template download link" |gunzip -dc |dd of=/dev/vda
How to check whether the VPS can use the template?
Under Debian/Ubuntu
Install: apt-get install virt-what
command: virt-what
Shown as kvm/xen/hyper-v
All three are suitable, others are not.
Detect VPS UEFI or BIOS boot
Install: apt-get install efibootmgr
command: efibootmgr
I can say for sure, support Oracle Cloud for free use,I have been running Windows Server 2012 R2 stably for more than a year.
All windows templates do not have activation, please use genuine authorization by yourself

VPN / Proxy Detection API
VPNAPI.io started out as a small IP address side project in 2017, where users would get the geolocation details of an IP address. Few months later, the first VPN and proxy checker was created. Within a matter of months, our privacy detection tool was thousands of times each hour, which check and tested each IP address to see if they were a potential threat to a website or business. Since 2017, our API had determined over 900 million API requests which considered if an IP was either a VPN, proxy, or TOR node. In 2019, we began implementing crawlers all across the net, in search for internet protocols that may be used for either of the three. The reason why we decided to create VPNAPI.io is to rebuild the perfect detection API from the ground up, which allows us to easily expand. Our goal is to constantly provide a service that can give you with the necessary protection in order to block malicious users and attacks.
Free Plan
Users can still use our services, however free users are limited to 1000 API requests per a day and server speeds may very, depending on the amount of free users using the API at the same time. For faster API queries, please consider purchasing an API plan.
"we strongly encourage users to limit their API usage to a 1000 request a day."
"Sign up and receive 1,000 queries every day for free."
JavaScript Obfuscator Tool
This tool transforms your original JavaScript source code into a new representation that's harder to understand, copy, re-use and modify without authorization. The obfuscated result will have the exact functionality of the original code.
So, it is like UglifyJS, Closure Compiler, etc?
Yes and no. While UglifyJS and others minifiers does make the output code harder to understand compressed and ugly, it can be easily transformed into something readable using a JS Beautifier.
This tool prevents that by using various transformations and "traps", such as self-defending and debug protection.
How does the obfuscation work?
Through a series of transformations, such as variable / function / arguments renaming, string removal, and others, your source code is transformed into something unreadable, while working exactly as before.

Free sites for education
I've seen threads like these before but it seems like it's mostly the same old sometimes outdated sites so I thought I'd update it a little bit. <b>I have personally used every resource on this list.</b>
Big four
These are the most commonly shared resources. These are the "big four" in my opinion, but they aren't necessarily the best or the most quality. If you're new to online learning, these are the ones you'll probably go to first.
 -->EdX Free courses from top universities, pay for a verified certificate. EdX certificates are probably the most valuable certificates here.
 -->Coursera Free courses from top universities again, pay for a verified certificate. Has more options than EdX.
 -->ALISON Lots of free courses with free certificates. In my opinion these courses are not the best quality but if you want some free certifications quick, it's good for that. I would personally advise against spending money there.
 -->Khan Academy Tons of free courses with tons of useful content, particularly in math. No certificates.
New resources
Here are some rarely-shared resources, and in my opinion they're the most valuable.
 -->Freecodecamp Free courses on web design 300+ hours each with free certificates. Incredibly streamlined.
Misc. resources
Here are some niche resources that don't have such a wide audience or don't offer certificates, but that I have personally found very useful and/or interesting and/or funny.
 -->School of Haskell Learn
-->YaleCourses Free video courses hosted on YouTube; a ton of really good information here. Of course, no certificates.
 -->Become a certified artist instantly It's a joke, but hey, free certificate! Remember to get a free randomly-generated
 -->artist's statement while you're at it, too.
 -->YouTube and hosted on Coursera. It's an okay course but I prefer:
 -->Catholic Online School Tons of free course with tons of free certificates...but it's an online Catholic school. I took a course for fun and now I have a certificate in, uh, "Secret Message of Our Lady of Fatima."
Sites to watch out for
These are sites I see being thrown around that I believe are either entirely predatory or just not worth the risk.
 -->Udemy Udemy is useful for learning practical skills sometimes keyword sometimes but the courses themselves are very low-quality, and sometimes make really dishonest claims like the hundreds of user-made courses that claim to certify you as a CBT / DBT therapist. Very likely to get scammed here. The certificates are worth jack shit.
 -->Shaw Academy Tons of shady reviews of this site. I've only used it once personally for their free trial; but I could immediately tell it wasn't worth the risk.

CrackStation
CrackStation uses massive pre-computed lookup tables to crack password hashes. These tables store a mapping between the hash of a password, and the correct password for that hash. The hash values are indexed so that it is possible to quickly search the database for a given hash. If the hash is present in the database, the password can be recovered in a fraction of a second. This only works for "unsalted" hashes. For information on password hashing systems that are not vulnerable to pre-computed lookup tables, see our hashing security page.
Crackstation's lookup tables were created by extracting every word from the Wikipedia databases and adding with every password list we could find. We also applied intelligent word mangling brute force hybrid to our wordlists to make them much more effective. For MD5 and SHA1 hashes, we have a 190GB, 15-billion-entry lookup table, and for other hashes, we have a 19GB 1.5-billion-entry lookup table

RainbowCrack Rainbow Tables
RainbowCrack is a general propose implementation of Philippe Oechslin's faster time-memory trade-off technique. It crack hashes with rainbow tables.
RainbowCrack uses time-memory tradeoff algorithm to crack hashes. It differs from brute force hash crackers.
A brute force hash cracker generate all possible plaintexts and compute the corresponding hashes on the fly, then compare the hashes with the hash to be cracked. Once a match is found, the plaintext is found. If all possible plaintexts are tested and no match is found, the plaintext is not found. With this type of hash cracking, all intermediate computation results are discarded.
A time-memory tradeoff hash cracker need a pre-computation stage, at the time all plaintext/hash pairs within the selected hash algorithm, charset, plaintext length are computed and results are stored in files called rainbow table. It is time consuming to do this kind of computation. But once the one time pre-computation is finished, hashes stored in the table can be cracked with much better performance than a brute force cracker.
In this project, we focus on the development of optimized time-memory tradeoff implementation. GPU acceleration is another key feature of RainbowCrack software. By offloading most runtime computation to NVIDIA/AMD GPU, overall hash cracking performance can be improved further.
Several TB of generated rainbow tables for LM, NTLM, MD5 and SHA1 hash algorithms are listed in this page.

Supercharge-Magnet-Links [Browser Extension For Torrent Magnet Links]
Chrome extension that adds more open torrent trackers to magnet links on all websites so you can find more seeders and peers to download from.
Installation of the UNPACKED extension:
1: Go to:
Press "Clone or download" and then "Download ZIP".
2: Unzip it somewhere.
3: In Chrome, open the extensions tab and click on "Developer mode" in the right corner, and then click on "Load unpacked extension..." and select the folder you just unpacked.
Some trackers might not work but others do and you'll hopefully find more seeders/peers.
Someone should fork it and have it add all these trackers instead:

This is my modified version. It removes some dead trackers and adds a bunch more the original was missing.

Which Email Provider Should I Use?
CORS Web Proxy
This API enables cross-origin requests to anywhere.
Usage:
/ Shows help
/iscorsneeded This is the only resource on this host which is served without CORS headers.
/<url> Create a request to <url>, and includes CORS headers in the response.
If the protocol is omitted, it defaults to
http
http if port 443 is specified.
Cookies are disabled and stripped from requests.
Redirects are automatically followed. For debugging purposes, each followed redirect results
in the addition of a X-CORS-Redirect-n header, where n starts at 1. These headers are not
accessible by the XMLHttpRequest API.
After 5 redirects, redirects are not followed any more. The redirect response is sent back
to the browser, which can choose to follow the redirect handled automatically by the browser.
The requested URL is available in the X-Request-URL response header.
The final URL, after following all redirects, is available in the X-Final-URL response header.
To prevent the use of the proxy for casual browsing, the API requires either the Origin
or the X-Requested-With header to be set. To avoid unnecessary preflight OPTIONS requests,
it's recommended to not manually set these headers in your code.

What Is A Digital Garden?
I didn't really know what you meant by digital garden at first. Does this article pretty much cover its explanation?
A knowledge graph of cybersecurity countermeasures & Incident Playbooks
D3FEND, a framework in which we encode a countermeasure
knowledge base, but more specifically, a knowledge graph. The
graph contains semantically rigorous types and relations that
define both the key concepts in the cybersecurity countermeasure
domain and the relations necessary to link those concepts to
each other. We ground each of the concepts and relations to
particular references in the cybersecurity literature. Numerous
sources of research and development literature were analyzed,
including a targeted sample of over 500 countermeasure patents
drawn from the U.S. Patent Office corpus over the years 2001 to
2018.

SerenityOS
Graphical Unix-like operating system for x86 computers.
SerenityOS is a love letter to '90s user interfaces with a custom Unix-like core. It flatters with sincerity by stealing beautiful ideas from various other systems.
Roughly speaking, the goal is a marriage between the aesthetic of late-1990s productivity software and the power-user accessibility of late-2000s nix.
This is a system by us, for us, based on the things we like.

I typically use a Jupyter notebook to run things. In Reddit - Opendirectory scraper.ipynb there are a few scripts to muck around with things.
The easiest way to scrape a directory is with the first script in the above mentioned notebook.
First, you'll need to get or generate a .txt file with all files found on the server with <
main.parse_txt extracts the movie name for each file and runs it through OMDB
main.output_movies saves the movies as a markup file, ordered by IMDB rating
main.index_single_movie saves each movie to the typesense index.

Tech Interview Handbook
Curated interview preparation materials for busy engineers
Brought to you by the author of the Blind 75 List
What is this?
The Tech Interview Handbook contains carefully curated content to help you ace your next technical interview with a focus on algorithms. While there are a ton of interview resources on the internet, the best ones are either not free, or they do not cover the complete interview process, usually only focusing on algorithms.
Why do I want this?
This repository has practical content that covers all phases of a technical interview, from applying for a job to passing the interviews to offer negotiation. Technically competent candidates might still find the non-technical content helpful as well.
Who is this for?
Whether you are a beginner to technical interviews or a seasoned engineer who have not been on the other side of the interviewing table in a while and want to get back into the game, the Tech Interview Handbook has got you covered.
Remote Software Jobs with a 4 Day Work Week
Do these jobs pay less?
You'll be working ~80%25 hours of a full-time contract, so some companies will pay ~80%25 of a full-time salary - for other companies there is little / no difference. Ultimately, you can decide for yourself if you think these positions pay less. Even if they do, you'll pay less tax meaning your effective hourly salary will increase
Am I still entitled to paid vacation / pension etc?
This varies from company to company but in the majority case, the terms of these positions are exactly the same as any "normal" full time job so you can expect to receive the benefits you'd usually receive e.g. paid vacation, 401k etc.
How many hours per week are these jobs for?
All job listings are capped at a maximum of 32 hours per week.
Should I mention I'd like to work 4 days in my application?
Each job listing is categorised as "open to 4 days" and "advertised as 4 days". If the listing is only "open to 4 days" you should mention that you are interested in being employed on a 4 day contract in your application. Either way, it's good to be clear from the start; there is no harm mentioning what job schedule you are looking for in the application.
Am I lazy if I only work 4 days per week?
Definitely not. When Microsoft Japan tested a four-day work week, productivity jumped by 40%25; so as the saying goes, you're "working smarter, not harder".

GamerMine
Gamermine is another amazing site with an active owner and some cool features. When you first come onto the site you will be greeted with a free dollar, which will be withdraw-able once you start earning. Payouts on this site are also instant, which is one of the big reasons I like this site so much. There is also a nice leveling system to give you bonuses for the more you earn. As you level up through the five tiers, you will get a bonus offer %25 and a referral offer %25. The bonus offer %25 gives you a certain percent more from every offer you complete. This maxes out at 10%25 once you reach the max level. The offer already pay decent and this makes them pay very well once you are given that bonus. If you have a problem on the site you will need to contact the owner on discord and he will usually help you out pretty quick. There is also an option to wager your coins on dice that is in site to make some more coins. This site is a close second to Gain.
Withdraw Methods
There is Paypal, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Amazon gift cards, Steam gift cards, League of Legends gift cards, and OPSkins withdraw options. All of which are instant. 1000 coins is $1.
Gain.gg
Gain is definitely my favorite site that I have found through the years. The owner is super nice and helpful and there is almost always somebody on to help you. Once you join the site you start unverified and withdraw won't be instant but if the owner or admins are on, they will put it through for you. After just a few surveys you will get verified by the owner and withdraw will be instant. This is the best feature of this site considering almost any other site that I go on it takes ages for my withdraw to go through. The payouts on Gain are pretty good and definitely better than some of the bigger name sites. With 5 different offer walls there is never a shortage of surveys. 10/10 site.
There is Paypal, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitskins, and OPSkins to cash out. All of which are instant after verification. 1000 coins is $1.

Be Aware of Techniques for Dilution, Misdirection & Control of an Internet Forum
Strategies can be linked back to things such as
Technique #1 - 'FORUM SLIDING'
If a very sensitive posting of a critical nature has been posted on a forum - it can be quickly removed from public view by 'forum sliding.' In this technique a number of unrelated posts are quietly prepositioned on the forum and allowed to 'age.' Each of these misdirectional forum postings can then be called upon at will to trigger a 'forum slide.' The second requirement is that several fake accounts exist, which can be called upon, to ensure that this technique is not exposed to the public. To trigger a 'forum slide' and 'flush' the critical post out of public view it is simply a matter of logging into each account both real and fake and then 'replying' to prepositined postings with a simple 1 or 2 line comment. This brings the unrelated postings to the top of the forum list, and the critical posting 'slides' down the front page, and quickly out of public view. Although it is difficult or impossible to censor the posting it is now lost in a sea of unrelated and unuseful postings. By this means it becomes effective to keep the readers of the forum reading unrelated and non-issue items.
Technique #2 - 'CONSENSUS CRACKING'
A second highly effective technique which you can see in operation all the time at is 'consensus cracking.' To develop a consensus crack, the following technique is used. Under the guise of a fake account a posting is made which looks legitimate and is towards the truth is made - but the critical point is that it has a VERY WEAK PREMISE without substantive proof to back the posting. Once this is done then under alternative fake accounts a very strong position in your favour is slowly introduced over the life of the posting. It is IMPERATIVE that both sides are initially presented, so the uninformed reader cannot determine which side is the truth. As postings and replies are made the stronger 'evidence' or disinformation in your favour is slowly 'seeded in.' Thus the uninformed reader will most like develop the same position as you, and if their position is against you their opposition to your posting will be most likely dropped. However in some cases where the forum members are highly educated and can counter your disinformation with real facts and linked postings, you can then 'abort' the consensus cracking by initiating a 'forum slide.
Technique #3 - 'TOPIC DILUTION'
Topic dilution is not only effective in forum sliding it is also very useful in keeping the forum readers on unrelated and non-productive issues. This is a critical and useful technique to cause a 'RESOURCE BURN.' By implementing continual and non-related postings that distract and disrupt trolling the forum readers they are more effectively stopped from anything of any real productivity. If the intensity of gradual dilution is intense enough, the readers will effectively stop researching and simply slip into a 'gossip mode.' In this state they can be more easily misdirected away from facts towards uninformed conjecture and opinion. The less informed they are the more effective and easy it becomes to control the entire group in the direction that you would desire the group to go in. It must be stressed that a proper assessment of the psychological capabilities and levels of education is first determined of the group to determine at what level to 'drive in the wedge.' By being too far off topic too quickly it may trigger censorship by a forum moderator.
Flood Detected. Post Discarded
Technique #4 - 'INFORMATION COLLECTION'
Information collection is also a very effective method to determine the psychological level of the forum members, and to gather intelligence that can be used against them. In this technique in a light and positive environment a 'show you mine so me yours' posting is initiated. From the number of replies and the answers that are provided much statistical information can be gathered.
An example is to post your 'favourite weapon' and then encourage other members of the forum to showcase what they have. In this matter it can be determined by reverse proration what percentage of the forum community owns a firearm, and or a illegal weapon. This same method can be used by posing as one of the form members and posting your favourite 'technique of operation.' From the replies various methods that the group utilizes can be studied and effective methods developed to stop them from their activities.

Technique #5 - 'ANGER TROLLING'
Statistically, there is always a percentage of the forum posters who are more inclined to violence. In order to determine who these individuals are, it is a requirement to present a image to the forum to deliberately incite a strong psychological reaction. From this the most violent in the group can be effectively singled out for reverse IP location and possibly local enforcement tracking. To accomplish this only requires posting a link to a video depicting a local police officer massively abusing his power against a very innocent individual. Statistically of the million or so police officers in America there is always one or two being caught abusing there powers and the taping of the activity can be then used for intelligence gathering purposes - without the requirement to 'stage' a fake abuse video. This method is extremely effective, and the more so the more abusive the video can be made to look. Sometimes it is useful to 'lead' the forum by replying to your own posting with your own statement of violent intent, and that you 'do not care what the authorities think!!' inflammation. By doing this and showing no fear it may be more effective in getting the more silent and self-disciplined violent intent members of the forum to slip and post their real intentions. This can be used later in a court of law during prosecution.
Technique #6 - 'GAINING FULL CONTROL'
It is important to also be harvesting and continually maneuvering for a forum moderator position. Once this position is obtained, the forum can then be effectively and quietly controlled by deleting unfavourable postings - and one can eventually steer the forum into complete failure and lack of interest by the general public. This is the 'ultimate victory' as the forum is no longer participated with by the general public and no longer useful in maintaining their freedoms. Depending on the level of control you can obtain, you can deliberately steer a forum into defeat by censoring postings, deleting memberships, flooding, and or accidentally taking the forum offline. By this method the forum can be quickly killed. However it is not always in the interest to kill a forum as it can be converted into a 'honey pot' gathering center to collect and misdirect newcomers and from this point be completely used for your control for your agenda purposes.
CONCLUSION
Remember these techniques are only effective if the forum participants DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THEM. Once they are aware of these techniques the operation can completely fail, and the forum can become uncontrolled. At this point other avenues must be considered such as initiating a false legal precedence to simply have the forum shut down and taken offline. This is not desirable as it then leaves the enforcement agencies unable to track the percentage of those in the population who always resist attempts for control against them. Many other techniques can be utilized and developed by the individual and as you develop further techniques of infiltration and control it is imperative to share then with HQ.

So meaning it will work or I still need
I didn't tried waydroid yet, was searching word "Nvidia" for workarounds
And arch supports it
So meaning, In theory, it should work, but any one can confirm?
No, duo to a bug in qt kde will be painfully slow
They fixed this problem in plasma 5.24 but you'll need to wait for it to be released
I'm not sure if this is the only bug that's causing slowdowns though
There might be more problems after this
So software rendering is the only solution for now
If you have access to kde beta 5.24 you can try that
It should theoretically work but it's beta software so it's not garanteed

Boots - Yesterday at 6:26 AM
It is with deep regret and profound sadness that we inform you that the Admin and owner of WebOasis may have taken his life yesterday. Around 4pm PST Admin posted his suicide note on his forums. We have no way contacting anyone or trying to get him help since he was a very private person and made sure to keep his identity a secret. In his note he assured us it had nothing to do with copyright or anything internet related and strictly personal. He also wrote would be up for a few months. He had a tendency to pay for it a few months in advance and we estimate it'll stay up for the next 3 to 6 months.
His site was what helped me and many others learn about piracy and privacy matters. In fact if it wasnt for weboasis I would have never found my way onto FMHY. He was a friend and while we sometimes butted heads on issues, I will forever be grateful for the time i got to spend with him. He will be missed.
Please if you are going through some tough times and are thinking about taking your life, please please talk to someone. Here are some resources you can call to get help and have someone listen to you
Suicide Hotlines in The United States
Crisis Text Line Text HOME to 741741
National Suicide Prevention Lifeline 1-800-273-8255
As per his promise, Weboasis admin posted the source code to the website. If you want to save it or even start your own version of it in memory of admin, here you go
you're reading this, than its already too late. Life is a game that I can't seem to win lately and I'm tired of losing. I know I'm not the first to feel this way. It's time for a new strategy. I just need to get away from this world forever. Clearly I'm not compatible. I'm sorry to my friends and family that will have to find me like this, but it's the only way forward. I've been at a low point in my life the past two months and don't foresee it getting any better. In fact it seems to be spiraling out of control even more.
Also, don't you dare blame this on guns. Someone determined to take their own life would find a way to do it one way or another.
Rest assured this is all taking place in my personal life and has nothing to do with WebOasis. I don't keep IP logs and your data for the forum and chat will remain safe and encrypted until the server inevitably expires months from now at which point it will be wiped/destroyed. To quell any potential rumors, I want to repeat this is a personal matter and has nothing to do with the site or copyright mafia.
Thank you to the loyal users that made WebOasis great. I want to especially thank those that assisted me with posting content/links and making graphics for me. It helped immensely.
I'm a man of my word and will post the source code publicly. Maybe someone can continue my work. I'll post everything except the forum and chat databases.
To the individuals in real life that are trying to ruin me, congratulations, you've won! You almost certainly won't ever see this, but if you doNow I no longer have to worry about you and you no longer have to worry about me. You're welcome.
Goodbye <3 Webby

Windows sort of assumes the user is stupid. Linux does not. But the user is always stupid, so I'm not keen on that assumption.

privacy.sexy
Open-source tool to enforce privacy & security best-practices on Windows, macOS and Linux, because privacy is sexy
Haveno
Private and decentralized way to #exchange #Monero for national currencies or other #cryptocurrencies. Haveno uses peer-to-peer networking and multi-signature escrow to facilitate trading without a trusted third party custodian. Disputes can be resolved using non-custodial arbitration. Everything is built around Monero and Tor.
Haveno is the Esperanto word for "Harbor". The project is stewarded by a core Team, currently formed by 2 people: ErCiccione and Woodser. See the FAQ in the wiki for more information about the project
Haveno is still work in progress. There are no binaries available at this stage. If you want to test Haveno you have to compile it first see
Status of the project
At the moment Haveno is only a Proof of Concept. It's already possible to initiate crypto <-> XMR and fiat <-> XMR trades, but the platform still needs a lot of work before being available for public use.

A small selection of Cybersecurity-themed computer games for those who want to use new scenarios of gamification in information security.
Replica
p.s. By the way, a good option for gamification or a script for a test task for an interview
Nite Team 4
A high-quality game with add-ons and even an editor for your scripts can also be used as a gamification option.
p.s. Don't make friends with the intelligence services of the Russian Federation and China - they don't give you a chance
> Hack_me
Hacknet
Cybersecurity Ops: Terminal
 is a very high quality browser game from IBM. Allows you to understand the importance of cyber protection of CII facilities
This game is a simulation of a hacker attack on an airport. Starting as an IT specialist, you must do everything to protect your facility - update the firmware on the router, patch systems, take inventory, etc. At the same time, you will later find yourself in the role of a middle-class manager and CEO.
p.s. Definitely high-quality implementation, thanks to IBM.
Threa
: Red vs. Blue
 - left this game for last, as it deserves special attention as a valuable copy, which is great for the option of gamification in information security, because it was originally designed for this very purpose.
As the name implies, this is a simulator of the confrontation between the Red team and the Blue team. The goals are appropriate, the resources are the same as in life - people, budget and time. Some need to competently build a defense, others need to bypass it.
An excellent option for gamification, since the game has a network mode - it is very easy to organize small exercises for one and a half to two hours. In addition, the developers are constantly updating the game and have made a separate enterprise product based on it.

OSCP Experience
This are the blogs I have found that have given me a good direction to start as I prepared for the course
 Prep
The Basics - Start Here
these are the resources I used to get more comfortable with linux, scripting, TCP/IP, etc. I recommend starting with these especially if you dont have much/any experience
Metasploit
although it has been said that Metasploit use is limited during the exam, Offensive Security recommends getting more familiar with Metasploit. I have been going through the metasploit unleashed course its really good info, i would be suprised if I dont have to come back to this repeatedly

noatsecure
Ungoogled chromium is an insecure mess. Their build flags show that clang isn't enabled, which supports control flow integrity CFI, something gcc does not.
Additionally, they don't even have the "is_official_build" flag, which disables a massive attack surface by disabling developer features. You can see the comment by Bill Budge, a chromium developer here:
I'd argue that 'is_official_build = false' means the build is intended to be developer-friendly and not shipped to end users, and 'is_official_build = true' means that any developer-friendly features that weaken security are disabled.

Hates: Bored of bullshit talks,bad guys,soup,for sometimes everyone,my life,my past,omy old self,gore,being alone and Etc!ver had friend well They say im weird/creepy/boring guy and no gf well a bored and alone person as i told u well life is short anyway i think of Suicide everyday and every moment... but i am still alive??
Finale: well thats all what i can say about. Now everyone know everything about me lol just about my feeling and my activitys so nothing is secret only my face. i think im the only person in here says every thing
The End
I'm falling out.. Theres no place left to go, but to release, and let go.
I'm feel like I'm done, with all and everything.
I'm finally giving up on life, theres nothing left for me to do.
I refuse to turn to drugs, but suicide is whats on my mind.
I'm tryin to get ME bak, but all I'm doing is changing my everything.
I'm falling out, tossing and turning at night, am I all a BIG mistake?
I can barely sleep, wake up to the same misery..
even with friends, I'm never happy..
Ever left all left alone, when friends tell you, 'I've got your bak' but you kno its not like that.
When you need a helping hand, all you receive is careless thoughts, and attemps to help. but none really works, I'm still goin to hell.
Ever looked at a Glass bottle, and see all and what you can do?
just crack it open, and slit your throat?
across the wrist, no one will ever kno.
Its used to be music, then I began to write, but its no used,
I'm on the edge, losing my mind.
I finally started to find, what was needed inside..
Suicide.
I thought bout it.. just for a while..
its the only thing to do, thoughts begin to twist,
its like a sad story, that no one will ever read.
I'll just turn the pages of my life,
and burn me inside.
Cuz I'm still alive..
but yet,
All I feel.. is DEAD inside
uhhhhh......
in some important moment you have one second and one life ofc
so do the correct move

oh death
"O, Death
O, Death
Won't you spare me over another year
Well what is this that I can't see
With ice cold hands takin' hold of me
Well I am Death, none can excel
I'll open the door to Heaven or Hell
Whoa, Death someone would pray
Could you wait to call me another day
The children prayed, the preacher preached
Time and mercy is out of your reach
I'll fix your feet til you can't walk
I'll lock your jaw til you can't talk
I'll close your eyes so you can't see
This very hour, come and go with me
I'm Death I come to take the soul
Leave the body and leave it cold
To draw up the flesh off of the frame
Dirt and worm both have a claim
Won't you spare me over another
My mother came to my bed
Placed a cold towel upon my head
My head is warm my feet are cold
Death is a-movin' upon my soul
Oh, Death how you're treatin' me
You've close my eyes so I can't see
Well you're hurtin' my body
You make me cold
You run my life right outta my soul
Oh Death please consider my age
Please don't take me at this stage
My wealth is all at your command
If you will move your icy hand
The old, the young, the rich or poor
All alike to me you know
No wealth, no land, no silver no gold
Nothing satisfies me but your soul
Won't you spare me over til another year
Won't you spare me over til another year"
DM me
If you have a wish or request or a friend got banned im open to forgiveness or.....
Dm me and if it be possible i will solve it.

VUCA
The problems I've identified in my old world are universal across the ideological spectrum. Ideology corrupts caring, idealistic, educated, and intelligent people and turns some of them into monsters. Ideologies breed dogmatic thinking and lazy, decoder-ring policy analysis. They encourage motivated cognition. They give birth to excessive certainty, crowding out healthy intellectual skepticism. They moralize political conflict in an unhealthy fashion, yielding incivility, extremism, and social discord. They ignore the complexities of the modern world.

Carding
The Course Instructor's intent is to spread awareness about the carding. The Course Instructor is not responsible if any damage occurs. This is for educational purpose only. Hello Guys, if you were a victim of carding fraud or really want to understand what is Carding and how it should be done then here I prepared the document which will clear the basic understanding.
Procedure of Carding process by KAUSHAL PAL :
Step1: Create the Email Id matching with Credit Card Holder Name.
If his name is Kaushal Palthe random name was taken, then email id should be Kaushalpal11
Step 2: Run VPN - Select the same country and closest city possible to CC Owner Address.
Step 3 : Now Run RDP and connect to the credit card holder location system to proceed. If you didn't have RDP, then follow following steps.
Step 4: Run Virtual Machine consisting of Windows 7/8.1/10.
Step 5: Open MAC changer and change the address randomly.
Step 6: Run CCleaner and clean all the unwanted data cookies/history/temp data etc..
Step 7 : Setup SOCKS5 proxy in Firefox.[Already explained how to set it].
Step 8: Be sure to use SOCK5 is matching to the location of credit card holder and be aware not to use Blacklisted IP. Check with , .Double check your IP is not blacklisted BL Check.Change your system time that match your victim time zone
Step 9: User Agent/ Finger Print Spoofing Tools FraudFox / AntiDetect. Change your system time that match your victim time zone.
Step 10: Use CClearner to clean all existing cache
the DNS cache by go to Run>type "CMD">enter the command "ipconfig/flushdns"
Start your carding
Step11 : Open the site for shopping. I want to recommend a website shop from your country because you don't need to wait a lot for your package.
Step 12 : Register with credit card holder information Kaushal Pal, name, country, city, address, and email.
Step 13: Shop and choose your item and add to cart. Precaution: Select item not more than $400 at first step.
Step 14: In shipping address add your address or drop address where the product is going to deliver.
NOTE: Shipping Address Is the Address You Want to Ship the Product and it may Be Drop Address if you need it .
Billing Address is the Address Where You Need to Give Credit Card Owners Address.
Step 15: Then go to the payment page and choose payment method like a credit card.
Step 16: Enter all details of credit card manually because most of site having Copy Paste detector script.
Step 17: Finally, in billing address add credit card owner address info and then proceed with the payment process.
Step 18: If everything all right then the order will get successfully placed.
Note : If You Are Using Drop Service Then Enter the Shipping Address which Drop Company have provided you and then they will ship product to address which you have given to them .
Step 19: Once the order arrives at the shipping address, receive it from delivery boy.
Step 20: Few carder arrange fake id if delivery boy ask for proof.
